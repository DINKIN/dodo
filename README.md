# Dodo

Dodo is homebrew 6502 SBC computer. The name is inspired from the book DroidMaker where it is revealed that the first version Lucasfilm's EditDroid was also named Dodo. Like the first EditDroid, Dodo is extinct in its design.

While obviously not a practical computer in today's world, building Dodo is still a fun and challenging learning experience.

## Goals
- Create a handheld gaming machine
- Utilize the 65XX series of chips where possible
- Use a Bitmap'd display
- Gamepad
- 3D Print an enclosure

## Links
This project would not be possible without others having documented their 6502 projects online. The following two resources have been invaluable in learning out to build a 6502 computer.
